# DynamicReport Project
## Overview
The DynamicReport project is a Java-based reporting solution designed to dynamically generate reports with flexible and customizable structures. 
This project harnesses the power of DynamicJasper, a dynamic JasperReports wrapper, to create reports on-the-fly with ease. 
The primary goal is to provide a framework that allows users to define report layouts dynamically based on runtime data.
